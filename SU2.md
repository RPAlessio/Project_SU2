What is SU2?

SU2 is an open-source code which aims to provide numerical solutions to partial differential equations. Furthermore, it can calculate constrained optimization of partial differential equations. At the beggining, SU2 mostly focused on fluid dynamics problems, such as incompressible and incompressible flows, external and internal flows and aerodynamic desgins. Nowadays, this open-soucer software performs multiphysical simulations, including fluid-structure interaction and chemically-reacting flows. Other solvers for applications such as structure mechanics considering elasticity and electrodynamics are also available in the software. From a simulation point-of-view, SU2 acts as a solver for the different applications being considered, performing all the calculations concerning the problem at hand. Therefore, the pre- and post-processings of the application are performed in different softwares.


Main Features

General Overview

As previously mentioned, SU2 provides different solvers depending on the application at hand. Each solver is developed by employing the programming language C++ and is designated to a specific category of problem. In general lines, this solver must be supported with pre-processing data, such as discretization feature and physical aspects of the problem. In order in order to create the discretization data, one may use the open-source software Gmsh. If one does so,
